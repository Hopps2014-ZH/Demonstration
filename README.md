Demonstration
=============

This is to give some insight into how all this git stuff works.
You should also probably google around for some sort of tutorial or explanation. It'll help, I promise.

Also, to get working on all of this, find that "HTTPS: Clone URL" thing and copy it. Start android studio and choose check out. Enter in that URL, as well as setting up your credentials and making a master password to make entering stuff easier.

Checking out like that downloads a clone of everything on here, which you can play around with and then reupload as a new commit. It's pretty danm cool.
